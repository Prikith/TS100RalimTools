Personal edits that i use that don't have a place on the main repo but i still want to make them available

build.sh $1 $2
either use without switches or specify both $1 and $2
$1 = build script version, does not default to value
$2 = languages and models, use like this: "-l LANG_CODE -m MODEL", quotes must be used because you want the entire line to be $2
